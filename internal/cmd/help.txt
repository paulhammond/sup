sup

sup is a tool for uploading files to S3 in a repeatable manner.

Usage:

    sup [options] <configfile> <remote>

Arguments:

    configfile
        Path to a config file. See below for details on format and options.

    remote
        URL of an s3 bucket, in the form 's3://bucket' or 's3://bucket/prefix'

Options:

    -h, --help
        Show this help text

    -v, --verbose
        Verbose output

Configuration file format:

    A config file specifies all options that affect the uploaded objects. This
    makes it easier to ensure that repeated uploads will produce the same
    result.

    The config file is a HCL formatted file. The simplest config file simply
    points at the directory that should be uploaded:

        source = "src"

    A more complex file can specify files to ignore, metadata to set on specific
    keys, and other options. For example:

        source = "src"
        redirects = true
        ignore = [
            "build/"
        ]
        metadata "**/foo.txt" {
            cache_control = "private"
            content_type = "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
        }

Configuration options:

    source
        The path to the directory that should be uploaded. This is relative
        to the config file and not the working directory of sup.

    include_dotfiles
        A boolean indicating if sup should upload paths that start with a '.'.
        By default sup ignores any paths starting with a '.' except for a
        directory called '.well-known' (to support RFC 8615). Alternative
        behaviour can be specified using the 'ignore' option.

    ignore
        A list of file path globs to ignore.

    metadata
        A list of metadata headers to set on files matching the specified glob.
        Can be repeated to apply different settings to different files.
        Supported metadata headers include 'cache_control' and 'content_type'.

    redirects
        A boolean specifying whether redirect files are processed. A redirect
        file is a file with a path ending in '.redirect' which contains a URL.
        sup will strip '.redirect' from the filename, and upload an empty file
        with an 'x-amz-website-redirect-location' header set to the contents of
        the file. For example, if your source directory contains a file called
        'example.redirect' containing the single character '/' then sup will
        create an object called 'example' with 'x-amz-website-redirect-location'
        set to '/'.

    trim_suffix
        A string suffix that sup should remove from any paths. For example, if
        this is set to '.html' and your source directory contains 'example.html'
        then sup will create an object at 'example'.
